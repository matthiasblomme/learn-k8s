                ConfigurationSpec is the schema for a exactly one configuration item.

                ***Note that the custom resource definition is **unable** to restrict this,
                since Kubernetes does not allow the use of `minProperties` and `maxProperties`

                This may represent one of several different kinds of configuration resource;
                - accounts
                - adminssl
                - agenta
                - agentx
                - barauth
                - db2cli
                - generic
                - keystore
                - loopbackdatasource
                - mqccdt
                - mqccred
                - odbc
                - persistencerediscredentials
                - policyproject
                - privatenetworkagent
                - resiliencekafkacredentials
                - s3credentials
                - serverconf
                - setdbparms
                - truststore
                - truststorecertificate
                - vault
                - vaultkey
                - workdiroverride

                A single integration defined in a BAR file may use one or more of these.

                Each resource kind is modelled in `Configuration` definition as a different field - so
                a single `configuration` item must have exactly one of those fields set.

                A subset of the resources contain confidential information such as passwords - they are;
                - accounts
                - adminssl
                - agenta
                - agentx
                - barauth
                - generic
                - keystore
                - loopbackdatasource
                - mqccdt
                - mqccred
                - persistencerediscredentials
                - privatenetworkagent
                - resiliencekafkacredentials
                - s3credentials
                - setdbparms
                - truststore
                - truststorecertificate
                - workdiroverride

                In these cases, the main resource content is held in a Kubernetes secret, and is represented
                in this object as a reference to the secret.
                The secret is currently restricted to be in the same namespace.
